## Features

- **AI-Powered Chat:** Communicates with an AI backend to simulate conversations.
- **Markdown Support:** The bot's responses are formatted using Markdown, allowing for headings, lists, bold text, and more.
- **Light/Dark Theme Toggle:** A button allows users to switch between light and dark modes with smooth animations.
- **Typing Indicator:** Shows when the bot is "typing" a response.
- **CSS Animations:** Smooth transitions for theme switching and chat bubbles.

   ```

3. Install dependencies:

### Markdown Support

The bot's responses are formatted with Markdown. For example, it can display **bold text**, *italics*, `code`, and lists.

## Demo

You can include a video demonstrating the chatbotâ€™s features. To embed a video from your PC, follow these steps:

1. Upload the video file to your project directory (e.g., inside a folder called `videos`).
2. Embed the video in this README using the following HTML:

   ```html
   <video width="600" controls>
     <source src="./videos/demo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
     Your browser does not support the video tag.
   </video>
   ```

Replace `./videos/demo.mp4` with the actual path to your video.
